# Wellington Water Take Visualisation

This repository contains a data visualisation of granted water constents issued
by the Greater Wellington Regional Council.

This data is published in an open dataset via GWRCs ESRI server. The data is unaltered, but presented geospatially within a scene.

### Motivation

I was looking for the opportunity to use the ESRI ArcGIS Javascript API's 3D capabilities. I particularly wanted to not use resources which required an ESRI developer access key (to facilitate future open data visualisations that I want to open source), which ruled out ESRI basemaps and uploaded, processed datasets.

### Disclaimer

I have a interest in public infrastructure, but no expertise. I've done my best to present the data within this visualisation with the correct terminology, but it may not be correct.

### Build

* `npm install`
* `npm serve`

The application will be served at `http://localhost:5000`.
